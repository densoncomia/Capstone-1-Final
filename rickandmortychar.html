She is currently employed as a veterinary surgeon at St. Equis Hospital.Characterized by a superiority complex and abandonment issues, Beth gradually came to struggle with her husband over his contributions to their marriage, due in part to his lower-level position and subsequent employment, further driven by her father influencing her feelings of superiority. Since their divorce, she has focused on raising her two children. However, by the finale she decides to reconnect with Jerry and they are living together with their children and her father.</strong></small>

He shares the same history as his C-137 counterpart until the Cronenberg disaster, where it was averted in his dimension.Jerry always tries to think of the best interest of the family, but his attempt to be the patriarch of the family can often be misguided by his self-centered nature. This causes him a great deal of conflict with Rick, as his father-in-law clearly has no respect for him whatsoever.</strong></small>

        <small class="name"> <strong>Portals allow travel between two different locations. Usually, these locations exist in the same universe. The only groups that have been known to use intergalactic portal technology are the Ricks and the Galactic Federation (Intergalactic Customs in "Pilot "). Some organizations and people have knowledge of interdimensional portal technology, but it is unclear whether they possess it or not (e.g. Time Court, Morty Smith (304-X), and The people of "Fart").The Portal Gun is a gadget that allows the user(s) to travel between different universes/dimensions/realities. The Gun was likely created by a Rick, although it is unknown which one; if there is any truth to C-137's fabricated origin story, then he may not be the original inventor. </strong></small>
