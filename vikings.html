								<p class="modal-title">The series introduces us to the brutal and mysterious world of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Viking warrior and farmer who yearns to explore—and raid—the distant shores across the ocean. His ambition puts him at odds with local chieftain Earl Haraldson, who insists on sending his raiders to the impoverished east rather than the uncharted west. When Ragnar teams up with his boat builder friend Floki to craft a new generation of intrepid ships capable of conquering the rough northern seas, the stage is set for conflict.But for all its warfare and bloodshed, Vikings is also a story of family and brotherhood, capturing the love and affection between Ragnar and his wife, Lagertha, a fierce Shield-maiden. It is the tale of Ragnar's brother Rollo, a fierce fighter who simmers with jealously; of Earl Haraldson's wife Siggy, a dutiful beauty who may be less than loyal; and of the monk Athelstan, whose Christian morals clash with the Vikings’ pagan society. As ambition and innovation rattle a civilization, these characters will be put to the test—and their way of life will never be the same again.</p>

								<p class="modal-title"> Part ISeason three culminated with the extraordinary battle in Paris, where Ragnar seized victory from the jaws of defeat – but still returns to Kattegat dangerously ill.

Rollo betrays his Vikings heritage by remaining in Frankia and Floki is seized for his brutal actions to the Christian priest Athelstan.Part IIIn the midseason premiere, Ragnar’s reappearance in Kattegat triggers a chain of events no one – except the Seer – could have ever imagined.

								<p class="modal-title"> Part I:In Norway, in the wake of the death of King Ragnar and his son Sigurd, the sons of Ragnar are in civil war. Ivar claims the title of king over the kingdom of Kattegat, supported by Hvitserk and king Harald. Ubbe sides with Lagertha against their alliance. In England, King Aethelwulf and bishop Heahmund wage war against the Nordic invaders. In the Mediterranean, Bjorn follows his destiny as he and Halfdan explores northern Africa. On the Atlantic, Floki makes a discovery that will change the world of the Norsemen forever.Part II:In Norway, Lagertha's army is on the brink of being routed from Kattegat, with Ivar prepared to captured the city and claim his revenge. In England, after the passing of King Aethelwulf, Aethelred rallied the Lords behind his half-brother Alfred and proclaimed him King of Wessex. In Iceland, the feud between the families of Kjetill and Eyvind escalate to the point where each of their sons are killed. Determined to prevent further bloodshed, Floki offers himself as a sacrifice.Season five returns on November 28 with the arrival of a legendary Viking, the famous Duke Rollo (Clive Standen), who causes further upheaval in a Kattegat still reeling from Ivar the Boneless becoming its King. As Bjorn (Alexander Ludwig) and Lagertha flee Ivar’s murderous forces with Bishop Heahmund (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), Ivar’s tyrannical reign over Scandinavia ushers in a new Dark Age, the likes of which have never been seen. Ultimately, Ivar’s reign will not go unchallenged by the sons of Ragnar and old enemies will become allies to defeat the despot who has declared himself a God on earth. Meanwhile in Iceland, Floki (Gustaf Skarsgård) battles the elements, and his own settlers’ desire for revenge, to forge a Viking colony on the beautiful and desolate landscape. </p>
